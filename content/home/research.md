At Apple Inc., I am a part of the Siri team. I contribute to the multi-lingual and cross-lingual efforts that are going around under the belt of _Siri_.

Prior to Apple, I was working at IBM Research, India on Natural Language Generation (NLG) problems for the last two and half years. I have participated in projects dealing with *data-to-text* and *text-to-text* generation paradigms. In *data-to-text*, our research aims at generating natural language descriptions from structured data such as knowledge graphs, tables *etc.* In *text-to-text*, our focus has been on problems such as text-simplification, text style-transfer and controllable paraphrasing.

My doctoral research comes broadly under the area of Natural Language Processing and relates to Machine Learning, Cognitive Science, Classical Linguistics and Psycholinguistics. The objective was to uncover the cognitive underpinning of human language processing and translate the insights to better algorithms in Computational Linguistics. I made use of the Eye-Tracking technology to record and analyze human eye movement patterns to gain insights into the human way of performing Translation, Sentiment and Sarcasm Analysis, and tackling linguistic subtleties during reading.

Apart from thesis related work, at IIT Bombay, I contributed to various projects related to Machine Translation, Social Media Text Analysis, Crowdsourcing and Development of Resources and Tools for Indian Language Processing.
