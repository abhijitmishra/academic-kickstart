My research comes broadly under the area of Natural Language Processing, Understanding, and Generation and relates to Machine Learning, Cognitive Science, Classical Linguistics and Psycholinguistics. The aim of my Ph.D. research was to uncover the cognitive underpinning of human language processing and translate the insights to better algorithms in Computational Linguistics. I made use of the Eye-Tracking technology to record and analyze human eye movement patterns to gain insights into the human way of performing Translation, Sentiment and Sarcasm Analysis, and tackling linguistic subtleties during reading. To know more, please visit the [Cognitive NLP](http://www.cfilt.iitb.ac.in/cognitive-nlp) website.

I have been fortunate enough to work under Prof. Pushpak who spearheads NLP research in India, and collaborate with Prof. [Michael Carl](http://www.cbs.dk/en/research/departments-and-centres/department-of-international-business-communication/staff/mcibc), Department of IBC, Copenhagen Business School.

Apart from thesis related work, at IIT Bombay, I contributed to various projects related to Machine Translation, Social Media Text Analysis, Crowdsourcing and Development of Resources and Tools for Indian Language Processing. Currently at IBM Research, I am involved in several projects based on Natural Language Generation.
